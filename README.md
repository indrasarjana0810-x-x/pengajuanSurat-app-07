A React project for group assignment implementing components, props, state, routing, and form validation.

---

## React + Vite

This project is built using **React + Vite**.

It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev & build performance. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.  
Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for more info.
